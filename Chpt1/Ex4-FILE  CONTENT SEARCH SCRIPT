#!/bin/bash
#1 File content search script
# Chapter 1
# Exercise 3: File Content Search
#Within the /var/log directory, search for files that contain the word "error" and redirect the results to a file named ErrorLog.txt in your home directory.
cd /var/log
# Search for files containing the word "error" and redirect the output to ErrorLog.txt in the home directory
grep -r "error" /var/log > ~/ErrorLog.txt
# Ensure the script has executed successfully
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Search completed successfully."
else
    echo "An error occurred during the search."
fi
# Notify the user that the search is complete
echo "Search for 'error' in /var/log completed. Results saved to ~/ErrorLog.txt"

# Notify the user about the location of the results
echo "You can find the results in the file ~/ErrorLog.txt"

# Ensure the script is executable
chmod +x ~/ErrorLog.txt

# Notify the user about the script execution
echo "File content search script executed successfully."    

#End of the script

#2 (Alternative approach)
#!/bin/bash
# Search for the word "error" in all log files in /var/log and redirect the output to ErrorLogs.txt in the home directory
cd /var/log
grep "error" *.log > ~/ErrorLogs.txt
