# Create a personal Wikidirectory named MyWiki in the Documents folder
#!/bin/bash
# Create directories for each subject in the MyWiki directory
mkdir -p ~/Documents/MyWiki/{Linux, Networking, Scripting}

# Within each directory, create a README.txt file with the following command:
cd ~/Documents/MyWiki/Linux && echo "Linux Overview" > README.txt
cd ~/Documents/MyWiki/Networking && echo "Networking Overview" > README.txt
cd ~/Documents/MyWiki/Scripting && echo "Scripting Overview" > README.txt


# Notify the user about the creation of the MyWiki directory and its contents
echo "MyWiki directory created with subdirectories and README files."


#2 Alternative approach to create the directories and files in one command
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/MyWiki/{Linux,Networking,Scripting} && \
cd ~/Documents/MyWiki/Linux && echo "Linux Overview" > README.txt && \
cd ~/Documents/MyWiki/Networking && echo "Networking Overview" > README.txt && \
cd ~/Documents/MyWiki/Scripting && echo "Scripting Overview" > README.txt

# Notify the user about the creation of the MyWiki directory and its contents
echo "MyWiki directory created with subdirectories and README files in one command."
