# Create a script to sort files in your downloads directory into different directories based on their file types.
# This script will create directories for text files, image files, and audio files, and then move the respective files into these directories, and its destination directory into a file named sorting_log.txt in your Download directory.

# Navigate to the Downloads directory
cd ~/Downloads
# Create directories for text files, image files, and audio files

# use a combination of mv and echo to move files to their respective directories and log the actions in a file named sorting_log.txt in your home directory.
# Create a log file to record the actions
touch ~/sorting_log.txt
# Clear the log file if it already exists
> ~/sorting_log.txt

# Move files to their respective directories based on file type
