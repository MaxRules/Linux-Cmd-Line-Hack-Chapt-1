# Exercise 10: Discovering Command Locations
# This script will help you discover the locations of various commands, binaries, sources, and manuals and all instances of the grep command on your system.
# Use the which, whereis, locate commands to find the paths
# Example usage:
#   which <command>
#   whereis <command>
#   locate <file>
# Document your findings in a file named "CommandPaths.txt" in the home directory using redirection.
#!/bin/bash
which grep > ~/CommandPaths.txt
whereis grep >> ~/CommandPaths.txt
#update database for locate if necessary with sudo updatedb
# Ensure the locate database is updated
sudo updatedb
locate grep >> ~/CommandPaths.txt
